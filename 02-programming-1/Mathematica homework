I did the Mathematica homework, but couldn't get the Git commandline to work, so couldn't get it up to my repository.
Sorry, it was just too confusing, and after a couple of hours futile trying had to give up.
(Also downloaded some git client, but it was equally confusing.)
Also couldn't reach the other group members, so did the task by myself.
